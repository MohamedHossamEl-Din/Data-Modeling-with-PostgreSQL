# Data Modeling with Postgres
---
A UDACITY Data Engineering Nanodegree Project

## About The Project
------

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The task here is to create a star schema postgeSQL database and an appropriate ETL pipeline that transfers data from files, in two local directories, into the database tables using Python and SQL. This enables the analytics team to run their analysis on the song play data.

## The Python Files

The project contains three python scripts, each has a specific role in ceating the database and the ETL.

###### 1. sql_queries.py
This python script contains all the SQL queries associated with dropping and creating the required tables in the database.

###### 2. create_tables.py
This script runs based on sql_queries.py.

###### 3. etl.py
Contains the entire ETL process.

## How to Run The Python Scripts

1. First, run create_tables.py

2. second, run etl.py

Make sure that you run the create_tables.py first each time you want to update your data in order to drop the existing tables and to get your schema ready before initializing the ETL process through etl.py.

## Datasets
---

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`


### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## database schema design

The database was designed as a star schema to optimize queries on song play analysis.

- One fact table `songplays` . It contains the metrics and data upon which the analytics team can understand what songs users are listening to.
- Four dimension tables `songs`, `artists`, `users`, and `time`.


## Conclusion
Now, Sparkify startup has their music streaming app data ready on demand whenever the analytics team wants to run their analysis.
